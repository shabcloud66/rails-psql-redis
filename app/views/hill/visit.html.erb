<h1>Jack and Jill went up the hill to get a bucket of water...</h1>
<h2>(Using Rails 3.2.latest and PostgreSQL, generated database.yml)</h2>
The bucket they got was:<br/>
Size: <%=@bucket.size%><br/>
Weight: <%=@bucket.weight%><br/>
Full?: <%=@bucket.is_full%><br/>
<br/>
Now they will have collected <%=@bucket_count%> buckets in total!<br/>
What fun!
<br/>
Still here?<br/>
<br/>
Last one!
